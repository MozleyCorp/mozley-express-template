# Mozley Express Template

Write a clear title for your README. While you're here, introduce your project.

Include any limitations up front so the user can evaluate whether the project meets all their
needs. This includes any version information.

You can also add a table of contents to the start of your README to help users jump to the
information they need.

## Explain any prerequisites

If applicable, list the items a user needs to be able to use your project, such as a certain
version of a programming language. It can be useful to link to documentation on how to install
these items. This could be under a heading such as `Before you start`.

If your project depends on other systems or projects, you should list these technical
dependencies. For example:

```
- [mozley/other-repo]() - provides some downstream service
- [redis]() - provides a backing service for work queues
```

## Explain how to get started

Next tell the user how to get started with the project. This is often a numbered list on how to
install the project and run it locally. List one action per step.

Follow each step with example code if possible as some users will want to copy and paste directly
from your README.

For example:

```
1. Install express.

`npm install express`
```

These instructions should help your users get to "hello world" or be able to run the project
locally. If you want to provide more advanced documentation, you could:

- add a configuration section to help the user amend the project for their own use
- publish separate in-detail documentation

## Help users configure and deploy for their needs

If applicable, include a link to any editable project configuration files. You could also:

- list any environment variables in a table
- link to more detailed configuration documentation in a different file

Describe how to deploy the project if applicable.
